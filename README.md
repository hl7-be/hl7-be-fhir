HL7 Belgium Community FHIR Specifications

This is a [FHIR](http://hl7.org/fhir) implementation guide containing the Belgium FHIR specifications. They contain the transactions and content for FHIR communications, including validating examples.
These specifications are driven and approved by the community of industry and government, according to the processes and governance defined by IHE (and future HL7) Belgium. 
These specifications do not imply any legal status - both communities (eHealth and HL7) intend to maintain one set of matching specifications as much as possible, but government authorities may differ punctually with these specifications.

Please contact us for adding to these specifications.
